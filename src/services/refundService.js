 * actually assigns on a tenant whose counter has drifted, so nothing
 * settles. This creates first, reads back the real assigned number, and
 * stamps it into the receipts instead — drift-proof by construction.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, RE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-17 on UAT with a fresh real credit
 * (Return transaction_id 153, Refund transaction_id 51) — this stamping
 * step does NOT settle the credit. BOTH leads this comment previously
 * raised have now been tried live and BOTH failed:
 *   1. Stamping ref_document_no into the REFUND's own receipts[] (what this
 *      function does) — Refund/Update returned 200, but
 *      POSReceiptsSelect/List still showed the credit fully outstanding
 *      (ref_document_no still "", balance_amount unchanged) afterward.
 *   2. Directly Update-ing the ORIGINAL credit document's own
 *      balance_amount/receipt_amount to 0/settled (the "one-off test"
 *      mentioned in an earlier version of this comment) — ALSO tried live
 *      this time: the Return's own Retrieve correctly showed
 *      balance_amount:0 afterward, but POSReceiptsSelect/List (the actual
 *      row getCustomerCredits() reads — see that function's own header)
 *      was STILL unchanged, ref_document_no still "". So
 *      POSReceiptsSelect/List is reading a genuinely separate
 *      receipts/ledger record, not derived from the source document's own
 *      balance_amount field the way Retrieve's echo of it might suggest.
 *      (Reverted that test edit back to the credit's real balance
 *      afterward, then cancelled both test documents — no lasting change
 *      left on the tenant.)
 *   3. Retrieve's own echo of what was sent corrupts the linkage —
 *      `receipts[].transaction_id` comes back as the REFUND's own
 *      transaction_id, not the original credit's — so `entity.receipts`
 *      is not safe to round-trip verbatim.
 * Net effect: money genuinely leaves (the `details[]` payout side works),
 * but the credit it's meant to close never clears from
 * POSReceiptsSelect/List by any mechanism tried so far. Whatever actually
 * flips that row needs a live network capture of OrnaVerse's own ERP
 * client (the only UI that has a real Refund screen — see this file's own
 * top comment) completing a real Refund end-to-end; guessing further here
 * risks touching real ledger/receipt state without understanding what
 * update actually closes it.
