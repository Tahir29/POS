// Cross-store Order/Invoice fetching for identities whose Order/List and
// Invoice/List are server-side restricted to their own home company.
//
// For at least one real multi-store identity, POS/Order/List and
// POS/Invoice/List ignore the company_id filter entirely and only ever
// return that identity's OWN home company's rows, no matter what company_id
// is requested. A dedicated single-store login is unaffected (its own
// company already matches whatever it asks for), so this module is a no-op
// for it.
//
// The two List endpoints are not the only way to reach this data:
//   - POS/OrderReceipt/List and POS/InvoiceReceipt/List DO honour company_id
//     correctly, even for a restricted identity. But they're RECEIPT-level,
//     not document-level — many real invoices have more than one receipt row
//     (split/instalment payments), each carrying only that instalment's
//     amount, not the document's real net_amount/balance_amount/line_items.
//     Showing these rows directly would list the same invoice twice with
//     wrong partial amounts.
//   - POS/Order/Retrieve and POS/Invoice/Retrieve (fetching ONE document by
//     its known transaction_id) are NOT restricted at all.
//
// So: use the Receipt List (correctly scoped) purely to DISCOVER which
// transaction_ids belong to the target store, collapse the receipt rows back
// into one entry per transaction_id (summing `amount` is NOT the real
// net_amount — it's only used to sort by recency, never shown to the user),
// then Retrieve only the ones on the requested PAGE for the real record.
// This path only runs when the plain List call has already proven itself
// unreliable for the requested company — see fetchStoreScopedDocuments below.
//
// PAGINATION: the grouped list (one entry per document) is the real,
// complete, correctly-scoped index. `take`/`skip` are applied to THAT
// grouped index, not to the raw receipt rows (a raw Take/Skip on receipts
// could split a multi-instalment document's rows across two pages and
// produce an incomplete group at the boundary) — so Retrieve only ever runs
// for the page actually being viewed, and `totalCount` reflects every real
// document.
